# Data Analysis of Clinical Attributes and Gene Expression of Breast Cancer Patients

Data Analysis project created by Antonio D. Barbosa in June 2022


## Description

According to [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/breast-cancer), almost 56,000 new breast cancer cases were diagnosed per year in the UK between 2016 and 2018. Understanding the impact of the clinical attributes and genetics of the patients may contribute to targeted therapeuthics, and potentially lead to the discovery of new drug targets.


## Source of the Data

This Data Science project uses a public available dataset containing clinical attributes, z-scores of mRNA levels, and information about mutations of 1904 Breast Cancer patients available from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database.

This dataset was collected by Professor Carlos Caldas (Cambridge Research Institute, UK) and Professor Sam Aparicio (British Columbia Cancer Centre, Canada). It was initially published in 2016 in Nature Communications [(Pereira et al., 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11479), and subsequently used in other published studies publicly available. The file used for the current Data Analysis project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric).


## Main Questions of the Project

**Question 1**: Does the age of diagnosis have an impact in the overall survival?

**Question 2**: Do the levels of HER2 have an impact in the overall survival?

**Question 3**: Does the progesterone status (pr_status) have an impact in the overall survival?

**Question 4**: Does the size of the tumor influence treatment?

**Question 5**: Are the changes in the expression of specific genes associated with increased survival?
