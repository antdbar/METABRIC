# METABRIC

## Description

This Data Science project uses a public available dataset containing clinical attributes, z-scores of mRNA levels, and information about mutations of 1904 patients available from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database.

This dataset was collected by Professor Carlos Caldas (Cambridge Research Institute, UK) and Professor Sam Aparicio (British Columbia Cancer Centre, Canada). It was initially published in 2016 in Nature Communications [(Pereira et al., 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11479), and subsequently used in other published studies publicly available. The file used for the current Data Science project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric).
